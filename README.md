# ASK ME ANYTHING

A new Flutter application.

This is my first ever interactive flutter project and its nothinf special;
it just generate differnt messages in random in pressing a button.

for example say "Should i watch netflix today?"
now tap on the button in the middle it will give you a random response like "yes" , "maybe", "ask me later" etc.

I am just a newbie so dont expect some great ui and stuff.
